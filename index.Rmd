Greetings! I'm a machine learning engineer at Meta working on video recommendations in our home app. I am one of team's first few ranking engineers, having been leading various 0-1 initiatives: 

* Reels early-stage ranking as a lightweight ranking layer that bridges retrieval and ranking that have contributed to double-digits Reels time spent increase since its inception;
* Contextual video chaining that delivers a real-time responsive chaining experience with recommendations highly customized based on the entry point surface and the seed video;
* First position ranking that provides a highly customized and relevant landing experience with ultra-low latency;

to support the rapid video product growth ([Launching Reels on Facebook in the US](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/), [Exploring Videos on Facebook Just Got Easier](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/exploring-videos-on-facebook-just-got-easier/))


Prior to Meta, I led a modeling team within Walmart's Customer org to build customer-centric data science and machine learning solutions to growing Walmart's customer lifetime value and the share of wallet. I was also one of the founding data scientists for Walmart's membership program, [Walmart+](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/09/01/walmart-introduces-walmart), and built ML models on Walmart+ customer acquisition, conversion, retention, reactivation, and lifetime value for informed marketing decisions. Earlier on, I worked as quantitative researchers at financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan.

I received PhD in Statistics from [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/), advised by Professor [Minge Xie](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/) and Professor [Regina Y. Liu](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/Liu-CV-05-2015.pdf), and BSc in Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).
