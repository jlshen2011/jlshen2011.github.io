Greetings! I'm a machine learning engineer in at Meta's [Reels](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/) recommendations team. Specifically, I've been leading the pre-ranking stage development within the Reels recommendation system, establishing it from its inception and elevating the system's ranking capacity, and contributing to double-digits Reels watch time increase. Most recently, I'm leading the contextual video chaining initiative, which aims to provide a real-time responsive chaining experience based on the seed video and entry-point surface. Feel free to check out the [demo](https://www.facebook.com/reel/24663978383201228), or simply open your Facebook App to give it a try!

Prior to Meta, I led the Algorithms team within Walmart's Customer org, where I spearheaded the development of customer-centric data science and machine learning solutions. These initiatives were designed to enhance Walmart's customer lifetime value (CLTV) and increase the share of wallet. I was also one of the founding data scientists for Walmart's membership program, [Walmart+](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/09/01/walmart-introduces-walmart), and built ML models on Walmart+ customer acquisition, conversion, retention, reactivation, and lifetime value for making informed marketing decisions. 


During the early phases of my career, I specialized in quantitative financial research, contributing my expertise to renowned institutions such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Deutsche Bank. My roles encompassed the intricate realm of pricing models and the formulation of market-making algorithms tailored for a spectrum of fixed income products, ranging from Treasuries and corporate bonds to various interest rate derivatives.


I received PhD in Statistics from [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/), advised by Professor [Minge Xie](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/) and Professor [Regina Y. Liu](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/Liu-CV-05-2015.pdf), and BSc in Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).
