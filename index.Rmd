Greetings! I'm a software engineer working on end-to-end video recommendation solutions at Facebook. I am one of the first few ranking engineers within the team and having witnessed the product growing from the first [Reels](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/) launch to nowadays the [Unified Video Player](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/exploring-videos-on-facebook-just-got-easier/). I have led various 0-to-1 initiatives, for example: 

* Reels early-stage ranking as a lightweight ranking layer that bridges retrieval and ranking that have contributed to double-digits Reels watch time increase since its inception.
* Contextual video chaining that delivers a real-time responsive chaining experience with recommendations highly customized based on the entry point surface and the seed video ([demo](https://www.facebook.com/reel/24663978383201228)).

Prior to Meta, I led the modeling team within Walmart's Customer org to build customer-centric data science and machine learning solutions to growing Walmart's customer lifetime value and the share of wallet. I was also one of the founding data scientists for Walmart's membership program, [Walmart+](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/09/01/walmart-introduces-walmart), and built ML models on Walmart+ customer acquisition, conversion, retention, reactivation, and lifetime value for informed marketing decisions. Earlier on, I worked as quantitative researchers at financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan.

I received PhD in Statistics from [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/), advised by Professor [Minge Xie](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/) and Professor [Regina Y. Liu](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/Liu-CV-05-2015.pdf), and BSc in Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).
