Hello! I am a machine learning engineer at Meta and work on [Facebook Reels](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/) recommendation. In particular, I have been leading the pre-ranking work team, building the pre-ranking stage into Reels recommendation system from 0 to 1, scaling up its ranking capability by 5x and contributing to double-digits Reels watch time increase. Most recently, I am leading the contextual recommendation initiative which has enabled a seamless video chaining experience where the chaining recommendations instantly respond to the video you click and engage with at entry points.

Before Meta, I headed the Algorithms team in Walmart's Customer Science group, crafting customer-centric data science and machine learning solutions to grow Walmart's customer lifetime value (CLTV) and share of wallet. I was also one of the founding data scientists for Walmart's membership program, [Walmart+](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/09/01/walmart-introduces-walmart), and built ML models on Walmart+ customer acquisition, conversion, retention, reactivation, and lifetime value for making informed marketing decisions. 


The earlier stages of my career are in quantitative finance when I worked at a few prestigious investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Deutsche Bank. I focused on quantitative research related to fixed income, including Treasuries, corporate bonds, and various interest rate derivatives. My responsibilities extended to pricing models and the development of market-making algorithms.


I received PhD in Statistics from [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/), advised by Professor [Minge Xie](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/) and Professor [Regina Y. Liu](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/Liu-CV-05-2015.pdf), and BSc in Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).
