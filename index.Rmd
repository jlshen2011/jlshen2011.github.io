Greetings! I'm a machine learning engineer with Meta's [Reels](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/) recommendations team. Among the various projects I've been involved in, I have been leading: 

* Reels pre-ranking stage as a lightweight ranking layer that bridges retrieval and ranking where I established it from its inception and have been contributing to double-digits Reels watch time increase. 
* Contextual video chaining initiative that aims to deliver a dynamic and responsive chaining experience in real-time, tailoring recommendations based on the entry point video and user interaction. Check out the [demo](https://www.facebook.com/reel/24663978383201228), or simply open your Facebook App to give it a try.

Prior to Meta, I led the modeling team within Walmart's Customer org, where I spearheaded the development of customer-centric data science and machine learning solutions. These initiatives were designed to enhance Walmart's customer lifetime value and increase the share of wallet. I was also one of the founding data scientists for Walmart's membership program, [Walmart+](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/09/01/walmart-introduces-walmart), and built ML models on Walmart+ customer acquisition, conversion, retention, reactivation, and lifetime value for making informed marketing decisions. 

My early career was on quantitative financial research, where I contributed my expertise to renowned institutions such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Deutsche Bank. My roles encompassed the intricate realm of rates pricing models, and market-making algorithms for Treasuries and corporate bonds.


I received PhD in Statistics from [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/), advised by Professor [Minge Xie](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/) and Professor [Regina Y. Liu](http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/Liu-CV-05-2015.pdf), and BSc in Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/).
