I have been developing systematic investing strategies for my personal account, aiming at superior risk-adjusted return than the S&P 500 benchmark. 

&nbsp;

## Enhanced Dollar-Cost Averaging

The dollar-cost averaging (DCA) method is widely adopted by investors to invest a constant dollar amount into the investment vehicle at regular basis. The strategy modifies the traditional DCA to adapt more to the current market condition that can deliver higher investment return and lower average than the traditional DCA approach.

&nbsp;

## Regime Switching ETF Portfolio

The strategy determines the boarder market regime using a proprietary algorithm, and invests in different ETFs according to the current market regime, not only to enhance the long-term return, but also reduce risk avoiding large losses.

&nbsp;

## AI Stock Selection

The strategy leverages a machine learning model that is trained on hundreds of technical, fundamental and sentiment indicators over thousands of stocks to predict their probabilities of price appreciation in the next one month, and constructs portfolios using the stocks with highest wins probabilities after a proprietary screening procedure.

At the beginning of each month, I will release the stock list selected at beginning of the past month and its performance over the past month.
