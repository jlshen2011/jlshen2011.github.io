## Welcome

I am a machine learning engineer at Facebook working on recommendation systems for <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/">Facebook Reels</a>. 

Before joining Facebook, I led a data science team at Walmart building machine learning solutions to understanding and forecasting customer behaviors. Prior to Walmart, I worked as a quantiative strategies and modelder at Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and J.P.Morgan. 
  	      
I received PhD in Statistics from <a href="http://stat.rutgers.edu/"> Department of Statistics</a> at Rutgers University, New Brunswick (advisors Profs. <a href="http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/home/mxie/">Minge Xie</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/Liu-CV-05-2015.pdf">Regina Y. Liu</a>) and BSc in Statistics from <a href="http://www.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of China</a>.
