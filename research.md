# Research

## Theoretical Foundation of Statistical Inference

Embedded within the [Bayesian, Fiducial, and Frequentist (BFF) community](http://bff-stat.org/), the research is to develop new methodologies with in mind the foundational principles of statistical inference, using the concept of confidence distributions. A confidence distribution can been loosely referred to as a distribution function on the parameter space that can represent confidence intervals of all levels for a parameter of interest, and encompasses and unifies a wide range of examples, from Fisher's fiducial distribution to bootstrap distributions, *p*-value functions, normalized likelihood functions and, in some cases, Bayesian posteriors.

Confidence distribution has shown to be an effective inferential tool in many statistical tasks such as classical parametric and nonparametric inferences, predictive inference, meta-analysis, etc. The research covers two use cases, personalized statistical inference, and predictive inference, both formulated using confidence distributions.

## Statistical Methods for Personalized Inference

<img src="images/idea.png?raw=true" width="600"/>

The research is to develop new methods and computing algorithms to make efficient and individualized (a.k.a. personalized) statistical inference by fusing inference from relevant data sources, thus named *i*Fusion. The method improves efficiency upon inference using individual data source alone, while still preserve statistical validity even when the fused data sources are heterogenous, and is well-suited for goal-directed applications.

## Predictive Customer Lifetime Value

<img src="images/clv.jpeg?raw=true" width="600"/>

Customer lifetime value (CLV) measures the worth of a customer from the customer’s relationship to the firm, and has been widely used such as by marketers to determine the ideal target audience for promotional offers, personalized customer messaging, exclusive deals, rewards programs, and by finance to tie the firm’s overall financial valuation to its customer base. The research is to study the statistical and machine learning based approaches to predicting customer lifetime value and to using it to develop customer-centric strategies.
