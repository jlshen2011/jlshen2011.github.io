## Theoretical Foundation of Statistical Inference

<img src="images/bff.png?raw=true" width="600"/>

The research is to develop new methodologies with in mind the foundational principles of statistical inference, in particular, using the concept of confidence distribution. A confidence distribtion can been loosely referred to as a distribution function on the parameter space that can represent confidence intervals of all levels for a parameter of interest. It is no different from a point estimator or an interval estimator (confidence interval), but it uses a sample-dependent distribution function on the parameter space (instead of a point or an interval) to estimate the parameter of interest. Some recent developments have highlighted the promising potentials of the CD concept, as an effective inferential tool






 it encompasses and unifies a wide range of examples, from regular parametric cases (including most examples of the classical development of Fisher's fiducial distribution) to bootstrap distributions, p-value functions,[5] normalized likelihood functions and, in some cases, Bayesian priors and Bayesian posteriors.[6]





The [Bayesian, Fiducial, and Frequentist (BFF) community](http://bff-stat.org/) began in 2014 as a means to facilitate scientific exchange among statisticians and scholars in related fields that  The community encourages and promotes research activities , 



The research proposes a general framework for prediction in which a prediction is presented in the form of a distribution function, called *predictive distribution function*. This predictive distribution function is well suited for the notion of confidence subscribed in the frequentist interpretation, and it can provide meaningful answers for questions related to prediction. 

A general approach under this framework is formulated and illustrated by using the so-called confidence distributions (CDs). This CD-based prediction approach inherits many desirable properties of CD, including its capacity for serving as a common platform for connecting and unifying the existing procedures of predictive inference in Bayesian, fiducial and frequentist paradigms. The theory underlying the CD-based predictive distribution is developed and some related efficiency and optimality issues are addressed. Moreover, a simple yet broadly applicable Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed for the implementation of the proposed approach. This concrete algorithm together with the proposed definition and associated theoretical development produce a comprehensive statistical inference framework for prediction.

## Statistical Methods for Personalized Inference

<img src="images/idea.png?raw=true" width="600"/>

The research is to develop new methods and computing algorithms to make efficient and individualized (a.k.a. personalized) statistical inference by fusing inference from relevant data sources, thus named *i*Fusion. The method improves efficiency upon inference using individual data source alone, while still preserve statistical validity even when the fused data sources are heterogenous, and is well-suited for goal-directed applications.

## Predictive Customer Lifetime Value

<img src="images/clv.jpeg?raw=true" width="600"/>

Customer lifetime value (CLV) measures the worth of a customer from the customer’s relationship to the firm, and has been widely used such as by marketers to determine the ideal target audience for promotional offers, personalized customer messaging, exclusive deals, rewards programs, and by finance to tie the firm’s overall financial valuation to its customer base. The research is to study the statistical and machine learning based approaches to predicting customer lifetime value and to using it to develop customer-centric strategies.
