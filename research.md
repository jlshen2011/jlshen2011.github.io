## Theoretical Foundation of Statistical Inference

The research proposes a general framework for prediction in which a prediction is presented in the form of a distribution function, called *predictive distribution function*. This predictive distribution function is well suited for the notion of confidence subscribed in the frequentist interpretation, and it can provide meaningful answers for questions related to prediction. 

A general approach under this framework is formulated and illustrated by using the so-called confidence distributions (CDs). This CD-based prediction approach inherits many desirable properties of CD, including its capacity for serving as a common platform for connecting and unifying the existing procedures of predictive inference in Bayesian, fiducial and frequentist paradigms. The theory underlying the CD-based predictive distribution is developed and some related efficiency and optimality issues are addressed. Moreover, a simple yet broadly applicable Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed for the implementation of the proposed approach. This concrete algorithm together with the proposed definition and associated theoretical development produce a comprehensive statistical inference framework for prediction.

## Statistical Methods for Personalized Inference

Inferences from different data sources can often be fused together, a process referred to as “fusion learning,” to yield more powerful findings than those from individual data sources alone. Effective fusion learning approaches are in growing demand as increasing number of data sources have become easily available in this big data era. 

This research proposes a new fusion learning approach, called “*i*Fusion,” for drawing efficient individualized inference by fusing learnings from relevant data sources. Specifically, *i*Fusion:	

1. summarizes inferences from individual data sources as individual confidence distributions (CDs); 
2. forms a clique of individuals that bear relevance to the target individual and then combines the CDs from those relevant individuals; 
3. draws inference for the target individual from the combined CD. 

In essence, iFusion strategically “borrows strength” from relevant individuals to enhance the efficiency of the target individual inference while preserving its validity. The research focuses on the setting where each individual study has a number of observations but its inference can be further improved by incorporating additional information from similar studies that is referred to as its clique. Under the setting, iFusion is shown to achieve oracle property under suitable conditions. It is also shown to be flexible and robust in handling heterogeneity arising from diverse data sources. The development is ideally suited for goal-directed applications. Computationally, iFusion is parallel in nature and scales up easily for big data. An efficient scalable algorithm is provided for implementation.
